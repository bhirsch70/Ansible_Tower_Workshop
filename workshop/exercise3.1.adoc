== Exercise 3.1 - Azure Provisioning Demo

---

****
This lesson is a hands-off demo, in which you can kick back and simply enjoy the show.

You're instructor is going to walk you through a few of the major components of the link:{ansible-azure_url}[ansible-azure project].
This project contains a playbook with two roles; one for deploying VMs, and one for tearing them down.

Section 1 - Playbook Structure

The ansible-azure playbook has a few constructs which will look familiar, and a couple which will be new.

The `ansible-azure` playbook contains a single playbook, several variables files, and two roles.

Section 2 - Playbook Content
====
*THE PLAYBOOK* +
The playbook is called `site.yml` and it contains two roles which use tagging.  This type of tagging applies
tags to every task inside of that role.  The way in which these are used is by specifying a tag on the command line.

For example, to run this playbook and only call the `deploy` role, you would run it like this:
----
% ansible-playbook site.yml --tags "deploy"
----

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false

  roles:
    - {role: deploy, tags: ['deploy']}
    - {role: teardown, tags: ['teardown']}

====
*THE VARIBLES* +
We are defining varibles for this playbook in three places +

- *group_vars/all/vms.yml* Enables the user to define the VM hostnames which will be deployed and/or torn down +
- *group_vars/all/vars.yml* Defines default variables +
- *group_vars/all/vault.yml* Contains an password that was encrypted using Ansible Vault +

link:{vault_url{[Ansible Vault] enables you to encrypt/decrypt senstive files and passwords.

====
====
*THE ROLES*
This playbook contains two roles; `deploy` and `teardown` .  Guess what they do! +

The azure_rm* module family is used in both roles.  It includes a number of modules for managing virtual machines,
NIC, storage accounts, etc.

First, let take a look at a snippet of yaml from the `deploy` role.  This task creates the Linux VM.
